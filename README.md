<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

The objective of this project is develop a machine learning model to support our choice, in soccer match result, increasing the chance of success.

### Frameworks

To run the notebook, it is necessary to install the following frameworks:

* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The notebook was developed in the environment [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb)

### Prerequisites

This notebook was tested using Python 3.7+

### Instalation

!pip install -U scikit-learn

(In case you already have the scikit learn installed, you just need to import the library before running the code)


<!-- RUN -->
## Running

There are 1 notebook to be executed. Data Scientist Capstone - Soccer Matches Predictor_v5, which is divided into 4 parts, following the [CRISP-DM](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining) framework. The database to be used is Campeonato_Espanhol, which is uploaded as well.


<!-- USECASES -->
## Use Cases

Motivation: Gambling is a practice since 3000 B.C. Nowadays, we have a lot of web platforms that explore since who will be eliminated in reality shows until all kinds of sports as snooker. Considering that I am a very fan of soccer and gambling, I am interested to start predict some matches considering the historical information and who knows, earn some money =)

In this project, we will use the La Liga database, which information is gathered and sourced by [jokecamp](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/football-data.co.uk/spain) a user on github

All the storytelling, developing and results you can find at my [Medium blog](https://lecunhad.medium.com/machine-learn-ops-gambling-d27dcb126ac3) 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Evaluate other kinds of models and optimization, in order to evaluate if one of them or other parameters

Collect other relevant pieces of information of crowd attendance, referee, players statistics and maybe other championships information which are running in parallel.
